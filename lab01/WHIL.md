## What Have I Learned

### gcc agrs

- `-o` output file
- `-g` grnerate gdb info
- `-c` only compiler, not link. generate `.o` file


### cgdb vs gdb 

cgdb is a lightweight curses (terminal-based) interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB). In addition to the standard gdb console, cgdb provides a split screen view that displays the source code as it executes. The keyboard interface is modeled after vim, so vim users should feel at home using cgdb.

### gdb usage

see [gdb.txt](./gdb.txt)

### fgets < stdin

run:

```sh
./int_hello < stdin.txt
```

gdb:

```sh
gdb ./int_hello
```

```gdb
run < stdin.txt
```

### valgrind

```sh
panda@panda ~/c/c/lab01 (master)> valgrind ./segfault_ex
```
```

```

`Address 0x1fff001000 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd` means that some the program try to r/w to unallocated memory.

- Why didnâ€™t the no_segfault_ex program segfault?

> 5 ~ 19 is undefinded, but still in stack(not unalloced memory).

- Why does the no_segfault_ex produce inconsistent outputs?

> 5 ~ 19 is undefinded, the value is unknown

- Why is sizeof incorrect? How could you still use sizeof but make the code correct?

> use `sizeof(a) / sizeof(int)`
